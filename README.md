# ‚ùì About This Project

CiderCSSKit is lightweight CSS parser written as a pure Swift package.
It was primarily designed to work with [CiderKit](https://github.com/chsxf/CiderKit), but the goal is to make it as agnostic as possible.

## Conventions

This project uses [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev) for its commit messages.

# ü™Ñ Features

CiderCSSKit is still a work-in-progress. So many CSS features are not currenlty supported.

Here's the list of existing and missing features:

- syntax validation is implemented, but you can create any property with any value you like, without control (`background-image: 10px` for example)
- provides easy access to style properties, in bulk or individually
- named colors are already implemented, but any other keyword will be interpreted as a string
- complex CSS combinators (`>`, `+`, and `~`) are not implemented
- no support pseudo-elements (like `::first-line` for example)
- no support for parametric pseudo-classes (like `:nth-child()` for example)
- no support for attribute selectors (like `a[target]` or `a[target="_blank"]`)
- built-in functions are limited to `rgb` and `rgba`

## Planned improvements

Even if the ultimate goal is to support all syntax features, there is a long road ahead. Below is a list of short-term planned improvements:

- [ ] Add support for the adjacent sibling combinator (`+`) ([#6](https://github.com/chsxf/CiderCSSKit/issues/6))
- [ ] Add support for the child combinator (`>`) ([#7](https://github.com/chsxf/CiderCSSKit/issues/7))
- [ ] Add support for the general sibling combinator (`~`) ([#8](https://github.com/chsxf/CiderCSSKit/issues/8))
- [ ] Provides basic validation configurations for most common attributes, functions and keywords
- [X] ~~Fix rgb() and rbga() methods ([#11](https://github.com/chsxf/CiderCSSKit/issues/11))~~
- [X] ~~Add support for all units ([#9](https://github.com/chsxf/CiderCSSKit/issues/9))~~
- [X] ~~Add support for chained CSS rules ([#10](https://github.com/chsxf/CiderCSSKit/issues/10))~~)
- [X] ~~Add support for shorthand properties (like `padding` or `border-radius`) ([#4](https://github.com/chsxf/CiderCSSKit/issues/4))~~
- [X] ~~Add support for short hexadecimal colors (`#fff` for example) ([#5](https://github.com/chsxf/CiderCSSKit/issues/5))~~
- [X] ~~Add support for the universal selector (`*`) ([#1](https://github.com/chsxf/CiderCSSKit/issues/1))~~
- [X] ~~Add support for pseudo-classes (like `:hover`) ([#2](https://github.com/chsxf/CiderCSSKit/issues/2))~~
- [X] ~~Implement ways to extend the capaibilities of the parser, with a specific model for custom validation and functions~~
